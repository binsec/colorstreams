# Benchmarks

We provide two distinct benchmarks:

- a [ground-truth benchmark](bench/README.md), composed of toy examples and well-understood real-world vulnerabilities, some manually instrumented
- a [realistic benchmark](magma/README.md), composed of OOB read / write vulenrabilities from the [MAGMA fuzzing benchmark](https://hexhive.epfl.ch/magma/docs/bugs.html), which are automatically analyzed

To help aggregate, organize and visualize results, we also provide a variety of [python scripts](common/scripts/README.md).
